## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### My favorite applications

- Integration of multiple media types (text, images, code, etc.) in a single page

2. Spotify

- Offline music downloads for uninterrupted playback
- Seamless cross-device playback control

3. Google Maps
- Real-time traffic updates and alternate route suggestions
- Street View for virtual exploration
- Location sharing with friends and family

4. Duolingo

5. Canva

### App idea: HealthSync, A Personal Health Tracker and Community
HealthSync is an all-in-one app for individuals to monitor their health metrics and connect with others for motivation and support. Users can log physical activities, meals, sleep, and water intake. The app provides personalized health recommendations based on goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, better sleep) and integrates with wearables like smartwatches. A unique feature is the community aspect: users can join interest groups (e.g., yoga enthusiasts, keto dieters) to share tips, challenges, and progress. The app would also include daily motivational quotes, reminders for healthy habits, and AI-driven insights into long-term health trends.

## Notes

- As this was my first experience with XCode and Swift, the interface of XCode was slightly overwhelming at first. There were many different sections of the screen and it was hard to find the information I needed.
- Also, learning the syntax of Swift, especially with the button, was both challenging and interesting at the same time!
